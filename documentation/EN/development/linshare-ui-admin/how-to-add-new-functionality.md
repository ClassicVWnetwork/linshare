## How to add new functionality on the `ui-admin` :

To do this, you need to clone the `linshare-ui-admin` project.

Open the project and go to `linshare-ui-admin/app/i18n/`, now you have to put your modifications in these files :

`locale-en.json` and `locale-fr.json`.

You must add the descriptions of your new functionality in the `DETAILS` section.
